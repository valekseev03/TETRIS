# TETRIS
Tetris game using Java-Swing where every row cleared reveals an image.

This was a project I made in my Senior year of High School. Uses Java Swing library. Place images in project folder and .java files in src folder.
Warning: The collisions are very wonky and to avoid errors will reset position of the block to the top.
